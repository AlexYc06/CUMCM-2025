# CUMCM-2025
China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling is a loaclly well-known contest just like MCM/ICM. This repository provides a solution of 2025 problem A, which won first prize in Shanghai. It's similar to meritorious winner in MCM/ICM. 

This can be a reference for people who would like to:
- prepare for modeling competition
- look for an example of optimization algorithm *(more specifically PSO)*
